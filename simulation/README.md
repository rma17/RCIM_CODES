Simulation codes for 4 out of 5 experiments
1. simulation.ttt is the simulation environment, it should work with remoteApi.dll,utils.py,vrep.py and vrepConst.py from Vrep.
2. base3.py is the main script for TAMP system
3. same3.py is the high-level module with trained model correction3.pt
4. MLP_VAE.py is the subgoal planner with trained model sub1.pt
5. dynamics.py is the action planner with trained model direction_1.pt
